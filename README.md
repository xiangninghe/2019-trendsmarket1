Thanks to the internet and social media, interacting and sharing knowledge is simpler than ever. These interactions provide businesses  with enormous amounts of data that can be used to get a better understanding of how users communicate and interact with each other. Community detection is the process of finding the community structure at a given time interval.Building communities can be challenging on large networks, however, Pyspark paired with the igraph package allows for users to create these networks efficiently. Using these tools we will address two problems: First, we will automatically detect the user's tight communities by analyzing a single user and his social network. Second, we will build a friend recommendation system: by suggesting friends for a user based on the mutual friends from their circles. Not only can these networks be used for recommendations, but segmenting customers for targeted marketing as well as fraud detection.
